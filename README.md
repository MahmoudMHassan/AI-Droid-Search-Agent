## Brief Description of the project

R2D2 is a droid agent from the rebel ship trying to escape its prison from the Death Star.
The prison is an (m x n) grid contains unmovable obstacles, equal number of rocks and pads and a Tele-portal.
The problem is to Escape From this Prison, the agent should push each rock onto the pressure pad to activate the
tele-portal which is replaced in a cell in the grid. The agent then goes to the Activated Tele-portal and escape.
The agent can’t push the obstacles or pass through it and can’t push the tele portal.
